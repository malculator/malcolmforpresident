        <p>We unconditionally support civil and constitutional liberties and are committed to protecting freedoms of
          speech,the press, and religion through <b>concrete legislative action to prevent censorship and build
            accountability.</b> We believe that <b>everyone must be equal before the law, no matter the social or
            political power they hold</b> — even presidents. We will protect citizens against arbitrary and unjust
          interference in personal affairs. We also support <b>federal protections to ensure that all citizens can vote,
            e.g. time off for Election Day.</b> We will work to reestablish reproductive freedoms like access to safe
          abortions. We are committed to supporting the LGBTQ+ community and protecting gender and sexuality diversity
          rights.</p>

    <h3>Environment</h3>

        <p>We are insistent on <b>working toward sustainable energy solutions and a circular economy.</b> This means
          that
          instead of supporting the “take–make–waste” system where valuable resources are extracted from the
          environment,
          made into products, and then discarded, we will <b>discourage waste and pollution through a carbon tax, keep
            products in use for as long as possible by improving their lifespan</b> (think reusable water bottles), and,
          at the end of the cycle, <b>make sure that recycling is widely available and just as easy as throwing things
            away.</b> Our goal is for the United States to <b>halve our carbon emissions by 2040.</b></p>

    <h3>Budget & Economy</h3>
    <p>We recognize the benefits that regulated immigration brings to the U.S. economy, and we support the <b>easing of
        visa restrictions in order to encourage safer migration.</b> We support a <b>single-payer universal healthcare
        system,</b> meaning that medical care for citizens would be paid for through taxes. This would result in a tax
      increase, but through the elimination of private insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs, this could actually
      lead to a <b>net financial benefit.</b> It would also prevent financial hardships due to uncontrollable diseases.
      Since high school age employees are the future of America’s workforce, we are intent on <b>supporting the safety
        and fair treatment of minors in the workplace</b> through protections against retaliation and standardized
      hours.
    </p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>We will provide <b>enough funding to schools to ensure fulfilling school activities and up-to-date resources.</b>
      We will work to make <b>financial aid for higher education more accessible.</b> We support <b>active student
        involvement in government</b> and we will work to facilitate open dialogue. We will introduce laws to support
      equality of opportunity for all students.</p>
    <h3>Government Reform</h3>
    <p>We will make the government in D.C. a government by the people and for the people. <b>No one is above the
        law.</b> We are <b>concerned by the gerrymandering currently happening in both red and blue states,</b> and will
      fight to stop the slide down the slippery slope to the destruction of competitiveness and fair elections. We will
      work to modernize the government so it is able to <b>deal with contemporary issues.</b> We will <b>protect and
        expand access to voting.</b> Above all, we will yield the powers of the government back to the people, ensuring
      that every policy decision is based on the needs of the people, and <b>safeguarding transparency and
        accountability</b> along the way.</p>
